## BAKE IT!

### Introduction

A website that is used for accessing and sharing baking recipes. Baking is quite popular at the moment with the great British Bake off and people seem to be passing time in lockdown by rediscovering baking. 

The site owners goal is to share and collect recipes and to advertise cooking equipment.

I have decided to advertise the brand ‘Pyrex’. They are a well-established brand and are known for their hard wearing well-designed products that can be found in most kitchens. https://www.pyrexuk.com/collections/bakeware

The main priorities for the site are accessing recipes, sharing recipes and advertising bakeware.
