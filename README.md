## BAKE IT!

### Introduction

A website that is used for accessing and sharing baking recipes. Baking is quite popular at the moment with the great British Bake off and people seem to be passing time in lockdown by rediscovering baking. 

The site owners goal is to share and collect recipes and to advertise cooking equipment.

I have decided to advertise the brand ‘Pyrex’. They are a well-established brand and are known for their hard wearing well-designed products that can be found in most kitchens. https://www.pyrexuk.com/collections/bakeware

The main priorities for the site are accessing recipes, sharing recipes and advertising bakeware.

### User Stories:
I have determined that there are 3 types of user:
1.	New Visitor:

    A non-member visiting the site for the first time. 

2.	A Member

    Likes to browse the site. Looks for the recently added recipes and Likes to share their recipes.

3.	Site Owner / Admin
	
    Approves new recipes added by Members and adds them to the site. Updates recipe categories. Updates Advertisements. Adds recipes.

There will be user stories for each user type and there will also be user stories that are applicable to all users. Such as UX i.e. recipe contents and layout.  Imagery etc… In these instances, I shall refer to them as a ‘User’.
